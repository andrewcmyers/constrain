# [Constrain](https://github.com/andrewcmyers/constrain) - a JS (ES6) library for responsive, animated figures, based on declarative constraint solving
![Triangle image](images/triangle.png)
- Supports responsive, animated figures embedded in web pages
- Figures implemented declaratively with time-dependent constraints on graphical objects
- Integrates with [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) presentations
- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/andrewcmyers/constrain)
- [Reference manual](https://andrewcmyers.github.io/constrain/doc)
