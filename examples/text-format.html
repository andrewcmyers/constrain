<h1>Text Layout Algorithms in <a href="https://github.com/andrewcmyers/constrain">Constrain</a>

<b>Explanation</b>: TeX uses dynamic programming to minimize the sum of cubes
of unused space on each line. Constrain does this minimization in real time 
inside an HTML canvas. It doesn't implement all the features of TeX, like allowing
overfull boxes or automatic hyphenation.
